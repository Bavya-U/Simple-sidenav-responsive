            <p className='container'>The owner of a brand website partners with an ad network, allowing ads to be displayed by third-party websites on their behalf in exchange for a commission. These advertisers invest their resources in developing creative and ads under the guise that the affiliates will help the brand reach new target audiences.

But many times bad actors find and exploit weaknesses by injecting their tracking link into PPC ads – unbeknownst to unsuspecting advertisers – in order to capitalize on the traffic hitting the SERP and earn commission from the potential conversion.

Once the PPC ad containing the affiliate link is clicked, it methodically redirects users to the brand site or fraudulent websites, scam promotions, and in some cases, dangerous malware downloads.</p>
